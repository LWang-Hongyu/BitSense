# BitSense

This repo contains our simulator and prototype code of BitSense. Specifically,

- `simulator/` contains a trace-driven simulator we built to integrate various sketching algorithms with BitSense.
- `testbed/` contains BitSense data plane prototype written in [P4$_{16}$](https://p4.org/p4-spec/docs/P4-16-v1.0.0-spec.html) that can be compiled and loaded onto Tofino switches.

We are willing to hear your feedback. Please let us know if you'd like to contribute to BitSense applications. If you have further questions and suggestions, don't hesitate to contact us at dr_abc@pku.edu.cn or huangqun@pku.edu.cn.

## Part I: Simulator Programs

### Files
Simulator programs include the following directories.
- `bin/` contains executable files after compilation
- `build/` contains intermediate objects generated by CMake and make
- `config/` contains configuration files for BitSense and the integrated sketch algorithms
- `data/` contains a truncated trace parsed from CAIDA
- `src/` contains BitSense source code
- `test/` contains BitSense testing code
- `third_party/` contains third-party code as git submodules

### Install Dependencies

We require the following dependencies to run BitSense simulator programs on Linux and Mac.

| Dependency | Installation (on Linux) | Installation (on Mac) |
|---|---|---|
|  **Cmake** (>=3.20) | `sudo apt-get install cmake -y` | `brew install cmake` |
| **boost** (>=1.75) | `sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev -y` | `brew install boost` |
| **libpcap** (>=1.9) | `sudo apt-get install libpcap-dev -y` | `brew install libpcap` |
| **PcapPlusPlus** (>=21.05) | Method 1. Build from [source](https://pcapplusplus.github.io/docs/install#build-from-source) using its default configuration and installation directory <br />Method 2. `brew install pcapplusplus`  | `brew install pcapplusplus` |

Simulator programs also make use of three third-party libraries, namely [eigen](https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen), [fmt](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt), and [tomlplusplus](https://github.com/marzer/tomlplusplus). They are maintained as git submodules. Hence, don't forget to clone them with `git submodule update --init`.
Besides, make sure your C++ compiler supports C++17 and python interpreter version is at least 3.7 to enable library features.

### Build the Simulator
The following shell script builds the simulator. As long as the dependencies are correctly installed, the script should run successfully.
```shell
mkdir -p simulator/build && cd simulator/build
cmake ..
make
```
To ensure each simulator module is built successfully, you can run `ctest` in the `simulator/build` directory. 
You should see the following line in the testing output.
```text
100% tests passed, 0 tests failed out of 8
```
After executing the script, you should see a number of executable files in the `bin/` directory.
Each of them implements a sketch framework indicated by its name. Note that a file named as `BS_XXX` implements the BitSense version of the sketch `XXX`. For example, `CM` implements the original Count-Min sketch, while `BS_CM` implements the BitSense version of Count-Min sketch. The following table lists the command of running sketch frameworks in the `simulator/bin` directory. 
| Command | Meaning | Command | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
|  `./CM` | Run Count-Min sketch | `./BS_CM` | Run BitSense + Count-Min sketch |
| `./CS` | Run Count sketch | `./BS_CS` | Run BitSense + Count sketch |
| `./ES` | Run Elastic sketch | `./BS_ES` | Run BitSense + Elastic sketch |
| `./FR` | Run Flow Radar | `./BS_FR` | Run BitSense + Flow Radar |
| `./NS` | Run NitroSketch | `./BS_NS` | Run BitSense + NitroSketch |
| `./NZE` |Run  Nearly-zero-error sketch | `./BS_NZE` | Run BitSense + Nearly-zero-error sketch |
| `./PR` | Run PR sketch | `./BS_PR` | Run BitSense + PR sketch |
| `./UM` | Run UnivMon | `./BS_UM` | Run BitSense + UnivMon |

The above command will read the default runtime configuration (which is in `simulator/config/sketch_config.toml`). If you want to specify a new configuration, run with `./XXX -c [path_to_config_file]` instead. 

You may encounter an error `FATAL| Failed to open record file ../data/records.bin. @data.h:769` at the first run. This is because the default data stream is `../data/records.bin`, but the file nonexists. We provide a sample stream parsed from a truncated CAIDA trace (much smaller than the trace used in the paper). You can download this file from the [Google drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o7YQdNVhQyAAe_naWXBGB7mOYQVmNF5T/view?usp=sharing) (or the [PKU disk](https://disk.pku.edu.cn:443/link/4BF2174500E4481C298BB1E9793CE85F) as a backup) and unzip it to `simluation/data`. Now any sketch framework should run smoothly.

### Sketch Configuration
Each sketch framework needs a number of configuration parameters to run, e.g., height and width and input data stream. The default config file (i.e., `simulator/config/sketch_config.toml`) has already specified a sample configuration for each sketch.
Note that the configuration of a sketch named `XXX` is listed in the table named [XXX] in the config file. Table [XXX] contains four subtables, each holding a number of parameters.
| Subtable | Description | Example | Meaning of the Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| [XXX.para] | Sketch-specific configuration | [CM.para]<br>  depth = 3<br>width = 10000| Configure a Count-Min sketch with 3 rows and 10,000 counters in each row |
| [XXX.data] | Input-related configuration | [CM.data]<br>data = "../data/records.bin"| Read the input data stream from the file `../data/records.bin` |
| [XXX.test] | Output-related configuration | [CM.test]<br>query = ["ARE", "AAE"] | Output the values of two metrics, namely `ARE` and `AAE`, after querying per-flow size |
| [XXX.bs] | BitSense-related configuration | [CM.bs]<br>cnt_no_ratio = 0.1435<br>width_cnt = [8, 16]<br>no_hash = [3] | Set the BitSense compression ratio to 0.1435, the width of counters on Layer 0 (and 1) as 8 bits (and 16 bits), and the number of hash function as 3 |

### Result Screenshots

We show the output format of BitSense simulator programs in this part using `CM` and `BS_CM`.
All other sketch frameworks have a similar output format. To display more statistics, you can add them to the config file.

## Part II: Prototype Programs

### Files
We provide a simplified version of BitSense data plane P4 programs, which includes the following directories.
- `countmin/` contains the prototype programs of BitSense with Count-Min sketches (CM).
- `sketchlearn/` contains the prototype programs of BitSense with SketchLearn (SL).

### Requirements

Make sure your Barefoot SDE version is at least 9.9.0.

### Deployment
We provide a simplified version of data plane programs that can be compiled and loaded onto a single Tofino switch since BitSense is a switch-local optimization.
The control plane program has the same decoding logic as the simulator, and we omit it.

For the two prototype sketches (CM and SL), the original sketch algorithms are in the file `cm.p4` and `sl.p4`, respectively, while the BitSense version of the sketches are in the file `bs_cm.p4` and `bs_sl.p4`, respectively.
The function of these programs mainly include parsing the TCP/IP header, measuring traffic statistics with sketches, and completing the basic forwarding function.

You can compile the aforementioned P4 files into target-specific code using the SDE tools.
When the program is deployed, you need to configure the port and add the flow entry.
